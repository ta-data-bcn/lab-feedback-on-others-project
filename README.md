# Lab | Giving feedback on a project's planning, structure and contents

## Description

In this lab, you will assess whether your colleagues have done a good job planning their project, structuring their repository and documenting their code files. The main goal of the lab is simple: tell your colleagues if you could understand their work and why. 

Before starting the lab, you will be assigned a partner. 

Follow the guidelines below to review your partner's project. 

## Guidelines

1) Look for the repository of the partner you have been assigned to.

2) Read the README file. After reading it, can you answer these questions?
  - Is the goal of the project clear to you?
  - Do you know what are the main questions that your partner wants to answer?
  - Do you know your partners' hypotheses?
  - What is the source of the data that your partner is going to use?
  - Has your partner defined any coding conventions?
  
3) Take a look at the folder structure of your partner's repository.
  - Is there a clear folder structure?
  - If you had to look for the data files he used, would you be able to do it easily?
  - Does the repository include a .gitignore file?
  
4) Now, look for the coding files (.ipynb, .py, .json, ...).
  - Is it easy for you to know what part of the analysis each file contains?
  - If you open one of those files, is there any text that leads you through all the code (comments, markdown cells, …)?
  - Read one of those code files. Does it have a clear purpose? (e.g: scraping a web, cleaning the data, …) 
 
5) Take a look at the commits.
  - Do the commits have a clear and understandable message?
  - Is your partner making enough commits? 

6) Ask your partner to send you his Trello link or to show you his Kanban Board. 
  - Are the tasks well defined?
  - Is it updated?
 
### Deliverables
You don't need to deliver any files, just give your feedback on the repository to your partner. Tell him about your experience trying to understand his/her work taking into account what you saw in steps 1 to 6.
