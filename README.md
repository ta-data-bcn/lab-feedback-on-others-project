# Lab | Giving feedback on a project's planning, structure and contents

## Description

In this lab, you will assess whether your colleagues have done a good job planning their project, structuring their repository and documenting their code files. The main goal of the lab is simple: tell your colleagues if you could understand their work and why. 

Before starting the lab, you will be assigned a partner. 

Follow the guidelines below to review your partner's project. 

## Guidelines

1) Look for the repository of the partner you have been assigned to.
    https://github.com/jbe1992/your-own-project

2) Read the README file. After reading it, can you answer these questions?
  - Is the goal of the project clear to you? 
    Yes, very clear. The target is well defined in README file
  - Do you know what are the main questions that your partner wants to answer?
    Yes, the questions are already written in the readme.
  - Do you know your partners' hypotheses?
    There are no previous hypothesis explained. May be they are not even necessary, because the questions to answer are related with job offers, so the data doesn't need to be interpreted, but only shown.
  - What is the source of the data that your partner is going to use?
    API's of job offers plattforms.
  - Has your partner defined any coding conventions?
    Not explicitly
    
3) Take a look at the folder structure of your partner's repository.
  - Is there a clear folder structure? Yes. It's structured within folders
  - If you had to look for the data files he used, would you be able to do it easily? For sure. There is a main file with the analysis, so it's easy to follow the structure of the project.
  - Does the repository include a .gitignore file? No, because he only uploads what he decides specificly, so it is not needed.
  
4) Now, look for the coding files (.ipynb, .py, .json, ...).
  - Is it easy for you to know what part of the analysis each file contains? Yes.
  - If you open one of those files, is there any text that leads you through all the code (comments, markdown cells, …)? Most of the content in the Project main file is widely guided and easy to understand. However, it would be useful to know what data contents each dataframe, specially those that are not shown with a head() function or similiar. WordClouds are very impressive also.
  - Read one of those code files. Does it have a clear purpose? (e.g: scraping a web, cleaning the data, …) 
 
5) Take a look at the commits.
  - Do the commits have a clear and understandable message? Yes, he has done a lot of commits and it's easy to understand what it was added in each one.
  - Is your partner making enough commits? For sure.

6) Ask your partner to send you his Trello link or to show you his Kanban Board. 
  - Are the tasks well defined? He didn't use any kanban software.
  - Is it updated?
 
### Deliverables
You don't need to deliver any files, just give your feedback on the repository to your partner. Tell him about your experience trying to understand his/her work taking into account what you saw in steps 1 to 6.
